"I'm a text bot generating vegan recipes to inspire you"
  
##How It Works

###Sweet/sour module
With this module, you can get instructions for sweet/sour recipes, which are rich in contrast.

1. Take something sweet & crunchy
2. Combine it with something sweet & soft
3. Add something sour
  
So the sweet food contrasts the sour here and the crunchy the soft.  
And sour/acidic ingredients are generelly said to bring out the flavor of your food!  
Easy, right? And it's usually pretty tasty :)
  
###Cookie module
This module creates variation on the most simple vegan cookie recipe!

1. Mash 2 bananas
2. Mix with 2 cups of oatmeal
3. Now the bot suggests some stuff to make it fancy (nuts, fruits, chocolate)
4. Bake for 15min at 150Â°C

Super easy & very tasty! :)  
I hope this bot inspires you a bit with your cooking! Have fun and experiment :)
